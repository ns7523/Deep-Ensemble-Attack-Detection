1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
KDD
3. Data processing
	- pandas dataframe
	- Keras processing
	- Dropping unwanted column

4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6. Feature Selection 
	- SelectPercentile using Mutual Info Classify
7. Splitting the data to X and Y for Machine Learning
8. Building the model
Machine Learning with Kfold
Logistic Regression
SVM
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Stacking Classifier (RF + ET with LightGBM)
Voting Classifier (RF + AB)
-    Deep Learning 
	    -  CNN
-  LSTM
- GRU
- RNN
9. Training and Building the model


Flask Framework
----------------

 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use NSL KDD Dataset for analysis different Machine and Deep  Learning models RF, DT and LSTM which got 96, 96 and 98% of accuracy respectively,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier RF + AB and Stacking classifier which got 100% of accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
