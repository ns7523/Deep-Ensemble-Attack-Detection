## Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Ensemble-based Efficient Framework for detecting network attacks. By combining multiple machine learning models, this framework aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of network intrusion detection systems.

## Features
- Real-time network attack detection using ensemble machine learning algorithms.
- Robust feature extraction and preprocessing.
- High accuracy and efficiency with deep learning models.
- Scalable to handle large-scale network data.

## Technologies Used
- `Python 3.6+`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `TensorFlow/Keras`
- `Pandas`
- `NumPy`

## Installation
#### Use Anaconda Navigator as base root
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download full project:**  
   [`Deep-Ensemble-Attack-Detection`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UoCuJOL7IKzSmy6OPq0xWVjoYo2OD_oI/view?usp=sharing).
   ```bash
   cd Deep-Ensemble-Attack-Detection
   ```
   
3. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Predetermined and Trained  KDD Datasets.
   - Tested and trained on 4-8 Lakhs of possibilites/datasets.
   - The application will analyze the data and predict the attack possibilites.

2. **Homepage:**
   - Access at `LocalHost` to predict threat detection and attack status.
